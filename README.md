# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracking-System-Using-Arduino

The Solar Tracker Project aims to enhance the efficiency of solar panels by designing a system that autonomously adjusts their orientation to optimize sunlight exposure. 
This report presents a comprehensive overview of the project's design, functionality, and future prospects.
The project's core concept involves utilizing light-dependent resistors (LDRs) to detect light intensity changes, simulating the sun's movement. 
A dual-axis solar tracking mechanism is implemented using servo motors, controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. 
The microcontroller processes data from LDRs and adjusts the solar panel's position in both azimuth and elevation angles to maintain optimal alignment with the sun.
The report outlines the hardware assembly, including the arrangement of LDRs, servo motors, and solar panels, along with detailed connections and circuit diagrams. 
The Arduino code for controlling the solar tracker is provided, explaining how it interprets LDR readings to execute precise motor movements.
Advantages of solar trackers include increased energy generation compared to fixed panels, optimization of land usage, and potential for rural applications.
However, challenges such as cost and maintenance are discussed in the report.
The future scope of the project involves integrating larger solar panels, implementing dual-axis tracking, and enhancing the control system with real-time clock (RTC) interfacing. 
The paper acknowledges the potential for more powerful motors and novel tracking systems, including dynamic weather forecasting and cooling mechanisms.

#Conclusion
The Solar Tracker Project presents an innovative solution to boost solar panel efficiency through autonomous tracking.
